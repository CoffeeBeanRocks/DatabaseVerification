In order to convert this project structure to an exe you need to use Pyinstaller.
Make sure all imports are included within Python by running main.py from terminal.
If you cannot run the main.py from terminal because an import was not found go to
Settings -> Project Settings -> Python Interpreter and manually add the import there.
After confirming that the project will run, go to the local terminal or main root of the file
(C:\Users\emeyers\PycharmProjects\DefaultTestAutoScript) in terminal and run the following command:
pyinstaller main.py --onefile --name="Default_TEST"
--onefile is a must as it compresses all files into a single .exe
